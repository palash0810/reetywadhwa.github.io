                                       <p> 21 June ·</p>
                                        India, a land where sane driving is a myth and accidents are common. I knew this – well, kind of. But looks like Murphy dint think I knew enough. ( He has expanded his influence with a 2nd law: Whatever cannot go wrong…will. )
                                        Last year, I met with a death defying accident and made countless visits to white robed people (no not priests, I am talking about doctors and surgeons)
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        Till last year, I was living my career dream, traveling the length and breadth of India addressing 1000’s of people through my signature talks and planning to make a mark on the globe. Then one day my career ambitions came crashing in a terrible road accident: 11 am, I was in my driving lane. The black SUV was in its driving lane. Its just that it was moving at super-sonic-speed. (The driver was Fast for sure, Furious ? – maybe). The car jumped over the road divider, toppling a 30 feet high street pole. As it was turning upside down, it landed onto my car damaging the right side of..my body. (and yes, the right side of the car wasnt spared either) I was pulled out of the other side by some good samaritans Manoj Goel, packed off into a PCR van and rushed to the emergency unit of Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital (Since that day government hospitals too are visible on my google maps)
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        His blood sample was sent to Forensic Science Lab (at least something exciting, Sherlock Holmes type, happened in this otherwise madass episode). The level of alcohol in his blood stream was found to be over 7 times the permissible limit. (Artificial Intelligence is no substitute for Human Stupidity). I guess the number of alcohol and soda bottles that were found in the car exceeded the number of seats an SUV has. (May be caution signs should now read: Dont drink WHILE driving)
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        <p>The aftermath:</p>

                                        What followed was months of acute pain due to plastic surgery on a part of the face, brain clot – subdural haemorrhage collection, spinal misalignment and many stiches on the arm and leg. (In an accident, the presence of mind is good and the absence of body is even better).
                                </p>
                            <p>Down but not OUT! YOUR GOOD WISHES</p>
                            <p>
                                    I felt shattered when I developed memory issues and sleep related issues. I lost control over when and where I just slept off, that too many times a day. My brain had experienced a seizure because of the impact. (even god’s brain is not sure about why he had to make the human brain such a complex organ). ( BTW, if you ever want to feel like a character right out of a sci-fi movie, get a sleep test done)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                    The Mental trauma and suffering;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                    Ok, lets get serious now…
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                    The situation got worse when I had a broken self image. I found it unbelievably difficult to accept this new person that I dint seem to know at all. I dint think I would ever be able to break free of this agony and integrate into mainstream, personally and professionally, like before.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                    My best support systems came to my Rescue:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                    Family dynamics changed as my family struggled with their own emotions and mine so that they could help me bounce back. Some friends selflessly and tirelessly helped me. Purnima Karia, a well wisher and a medical professional from USA helped me over a series of phone calls and suggested I have a look at www.neuroskills.com. I remember wanting to grab anything that offered any hope and consumed the online content.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                    The treatment: <br>

                                   <p> What followed for almost a year were uncountable visits to a panel of doctors – physiotherapists, neurologists, orthopadecians, chiropractors, dermatologists. After a roller coaster emotional journey of loss and triumph, I have recently started working again !
                                    Needless to say, I am a lot more appreciative of life and have decided to live ‘happily ever after’ (one moment at a time)
                                   </p>
                                    <p>
                                    The courtroom drama with people in black robes (and hearts ?) is yet to unfold.
                                    (You see, it has barely been a year ! Too early by Indian standards for any judicial movement)
                                    </p>
                                    <br>
                                    To quote Woody Allen: <br>
                                    (Life is full of misery, loneliness, and suffering – and it’s all over too soon !)
                                    <br>
                                    <p> Dear friends, followers, fans (FFFs)…….. I’m back।’ – as ReWa </p>

                                    <p>
                                            “A trainer, entrepreneur and coach by profession. A marketeer by passion. A wanderer by personality.” This is how Reety Wadhwa is described in her introduction as a TEDx Delhi Speaker Coach. Yet, these few lines hardly capture the breadth and depth of Reety’s story. After working in the corporate world for a period, she left to pursue her passion of becoming a business speaker and brand strategist. She works on nurturing a niche concept of how behavioural economics can help shape branding decisions.A setback in her life came when she was involved in a life-threatening accident. Recovery led to a period of soul-searching and self-doubt but in her words she came out of it like a ‘phoenix’ and set up her company – ReWA Chaotic Thrills. ReWa is an acronym for Reliable, Womanist, Enterprising and Achiever. She has been featured on NDTV Prime and other leading Indian news outlets.
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            <strong>Establishing the business</strong>
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            This business idea came to Reety when she was reflecting on Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs. She realised she could create, empower and self actualise with the profession of speaking. She quit her corporate job and took the plunge. In a short period, she established a reputation as a great speaker and a brand strategist addressing thousands of people throughout India. She has also delivered keynotes at premier universities and is slated for one at IIM Kashipur soon. Her business is called ReWa Chaotic Thrills. Of course, there is the play on her name, but ReWa is also an acronym for Reliable, Womanist, Enterprising and Achiever, qualities she values and embodies in her daily life.
                                            <br>
                                            Reety thinks of herself as a wanderer. But not in the traditional sense. Explaining this aspect of her identity, she elucidates, “There are 100 billion neurons in our brain. These are capable of so much assimilation and connection. A ‘wanderer’ to me is someone who constantly tries to satisfy one’s brain by letting it wander. Trying out different things, experiencing novelty and not being defined by one’s profession alone.”

                                            <br>
                                            <strong>Cherished belief</strong>
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            Reety believes in the concept of borderless growth. She says, “Though political boundaries are here to stay for now, humanity doesn’t have to be bound by arbitrarily created barriers in its quest for growth and development.”
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            <strong>The setback</strong>
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            As she puts it, setting up the business was easy. But her near tryst with death, in an accident, and the long process of recovery were the biggest challenge. She describes that time as one with “Physical and mental barriers, with a forced sabbatical the length of which was unpredictable and then there was the agony of having to push the re-establish button threw me into trenches.”
                                            <br>
                                            She was up for the challenge though and says, “But today, as the proverbial phoenix, I can confidently say this: one has to know the trenches to truly experience the heights.”
                                            <br>
                                            Reety was recently chosen for “Womennovator: 100 Women Faces”, an initiative to recognise and celebrate the achievements of women pioneers who have carved a niche in their chosen fields. This recognition is a validation of her talent, grit and invincible spirit.

                                            <br>
                                            Reety says of her experience with the platform that, “My business mentor, Mr Dhananjay Parkhe told me about GlobalLinker. It has helped me connect with a segment that is the backbone of the GDP.”

                                            Reety’s vision is to to revolutionise the way brands and startups globally grow. She believes there is huge potential in the “sheer power of their narrative(s) and cognitive influence on the consumers’ brain.”
                                            <br>
                                            There are currently many exciting projects in the pipeline including talk shows on startups, road safety and immediate medical aid. Other projects include talks with CXOs, International Business Keynotes that features leading minds in business, and work on the theme of “I am Every Woman”
